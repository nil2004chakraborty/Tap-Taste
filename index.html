                    <h4>Matar Paneer</h4>
                    <p class="desc">Matar paneer, also sometimes called mutter paneer, is a classic vegetarian dish from North India. It features cubes of paneer, a fresh Indian cheese similar to cottage cheese, simmered in a rich tomato-based gravy with green peas. The dish is known for its creamy texture, vibrant color, and delightful blend of savory and aromatic spices. It's a popular choice for both home cooks and restaurants, and pairs perfectly with rice or Indian flatbreads like roti or naan.</p>

                    <h4>Kadhi Chawal</h4>
                    <p class="desc">Kadhi, a vibrant dish from Rajasthan, India, is a symphony of tangy yogurt and savory spices. This vegetarian curry features a creamy base made by whisking yogurt with gram flour (besan), creating a delightful contrast with the pops of flavor from spices like turmeric, cumin, and fenugreek. Often enjoyed with rice or Indian flatbreads, kadhi comes in regional variations. Some versions boast crispy pakoras (fritters) dipped in the gravy, while others keep it simple and flavorful without them.</p>

                    <h4>Soyabean curry</h4>
                    <p class="desc">Soyabean curry is a vegetarian champion, offering a protein-packed and flavorful alternative to meat-based dishes.  This versatile curry utilizes either dried or fresh soybeans, simmered in a fragrant blend of spices like turmeric, cumin, and coriander. The result is a savory and slightly spicy curry with a richness that satisfies. The texture of the soybeans can be customized, offering a smooth experience when cooked tender or a delightful bite when left a little firmer. Perfect with fluffy rice or Indian flatbreads like roti or naan, soyabean curry is a delicious and nourishing meal.</p>
